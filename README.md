# What's My Most Twitter Bot
A Twitter bot that responds to users with a link to their most liked or most retweeted tweet, based on their mention to the bot. This bot uses Tweepy API and data scraping to get the users public information, without having to sign into the users profile account. The purpose of this bot is to prevent the need for Twitter users to sign into other second-hand sights and risk the possibility of getting their private password and sensitive information from being stolen.
